# HTML Gulp SASS Starter

Robots can't dance...yet, but at least Gulp can help us automating tasks for a smooth front-end process.

This repo is a very basic starter theme that I use for my projecs or WP themes.

Go ahead and please grab it or feel free to contribute.

If you fork the repo, just remember to run the `npm install` command and start coding :)
